## Challenge

Use React to create a simple Pomodoro timer. It will be static, without the need for a server.
The app will be build with Parcel.

### Features

-   [x] Display a big timer (minutes and seconds)
-   Four buttons :
    -   [ ] plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped
    -   [x] start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
    -   [x] reset, to reset the timer to its original value
-   [ ] At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:
    -   one to close the modal
    -   another to close the modal and start a new timer
